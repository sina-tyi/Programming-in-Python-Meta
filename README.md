# Programming-in-Python-Meta
This repository includes 5 introductory and useful Python practices from the Meta Back-End Development course.

# Prerequisites
you don’t need any previous development experience. Just a simple understanding of Python would be enough for implementing these practices.
You must simply be willing to get started with coding in Python!

# Practice 1 & 2

These practices include how to declare a function, and how to pass data to a function or return data from a function. You will also explore data structures,
scope, and the concepts of lists and how they can be used in Python. You will also discover tuples, sets, dictionaries and kwargs, 
gaining an understanding of how their main uses.


# Practice 3 & 4

In the third module, you will cover programming paradigms, and look at the features and concepts behind procedural programming,functional programming and object
oriented programming. A key feature of procedural programming is algorithms, you will explore how they can be used to solve problems,
how algorithmic complexity is calculated and learn about Big-O notation.

Next you will learn about pure functions and recursion in functional programming, as well as the difference between maps and filters.


Finally, you will explore object-oriented programming and its four main concepts. You will explore the relationship between classes and instances in Python by creating classes, instantiating them, and accessing their variables and methods.
You’ll learn about abstract classes and methods and how to implement them. The rules of method resolution and inheritance with child and parent classes are also explained.
Being able to read files is essential when working with stored data in Python and you’ll discover several built-in functions
to make this easier. 

# Practice 5

In this practice you’ll find out why testing is an essential component of Quality Assurance and explore the type of testing you should use.
You will learn about test automation packages and the importance of automated testing and you’ll write some tests using PyTest.
